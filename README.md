# Reprogram-Database-System
This project is to reprogram the database system of a Chinese Investment Management Company based on Python. The database system aims to monitor the difference between the predictive results of trading strategies and the actual results of trading operations. Commonly they should have slight difference, so this system can help to monitor problems which happen during the daily trading operations.
